## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Impala** transforms complex decentralized finance (DeFi) into an engaging, gamified experience that makes onchain wealth building accessible to everyone. We combine AI-powered financial guidance with playful gamification mechanics to onboard the next billion users into Web3 finance.

> **TL;DR:** Think "Duolingo meets Robinhood for DeFi" - making wealth building fun, educational, and accessible.

## 📊 The Problem: Why 99% Don't Use DeFi

### **The DeFi Accessibility Crisis**
- **Complexity Overload**: 87% of potential users find DeFi interfaces intimidating and confusing
- **Risk Paralysis**: Users fear making costly mistakes in irreversible blockchain transactions
- **Information Asymmetry**: Professional traders have tools; retail users have guesswork
- **Zero Engagement**: Traditional finance apps are boring - no rewards for learning or consistency
- **Fragmented Experience**: Users juggle 5+ different apps for basic financial operations

### **The Opportunity Gap**
The global DeFi market is projected to reach **$231 billion by 2030**, yet less than 1% of internet users actively participate. The missing piece isn't technology - it's **user experience**.
